            My name is Samyak Jain. I'm a junior at Northwestern University and this has been my favorite year at college. Online classes have been
            an amazing experience for my education. The best part is, I'm fully aware that this was the best course of action!
            I loved getting sent home 3 months early and living with my parents again. I'm happy to be back in my home town of Medina, Minnesota.
            While I still get to experience dramatic weather swings and passive aggressive white people, I get all my social contact with friends
            through Discord. It's truly is a win-win. 
            But anyway, let me get back to my job experience. I worked as a software developer for Darwin Insights, an advertising consulting 
            agency, in summer of 2019. I then obtained a position as financial analyst in the summer of 2020. While I was going to 
            live with friends near San Fransisco for my internship, I now have to chance to live with my parents for an additional 3 months 
            in the summer. I'm so grateful for the joys 2020 has brought to my life.
